# Gangle_AI
I made this Gangle AI assistant for a friend of a friend but I decided to make it available to everyone.
The only requirement necessary to run this program is LM Studio running any AI model you want and a server 
running via LM Studio on port 1234. She can play youtube videos just by asking her (no you don't need a web
browser open, she'll do it for you), she acts exactly like the character from the show and she even has the 
masks. Create a file in your downloads folder called Gangle_AI. Then, take every file provided here (except
the .7z files, extract those) and put them in Gangle_AI. The actual assistant app should be in the "build"
folder.
