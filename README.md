# Gangle_AI
I made this Gangle AI assistant for a friend of a friend but I decided to make it available to everyone.
The only requirement necessary to run this program is LM Studio running any AI model you want and a server 
running via LM Studio on port 1234. She can play youtube videos just by asking her (no you don't need a web
browser open, she'll do it for you), she acts exactly like the character from the show and she even has the 
masks. The actual app is located in the "dist" folder. It's called "Gangle_AI.exe"
